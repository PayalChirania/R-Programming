Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given enough aid. It’s especially tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. The world’s poorest typically can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify. 
This project helps to identify individuals and households that have the greatest need of financial aid.

Algorithms used: KNN Algorithm, XGBoost and Random Forest.
